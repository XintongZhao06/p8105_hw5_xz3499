Comment:

The probability curve grows rapidly in an S shape. When the number of
people in a group is 23, the probability exceeds 50%. When the number of
people in a group is around 40, the probability exceeds 90%. This goes
against our intuition that 183 people are needed to have a 50% chance.
This is because as the number of people increases, the possible number
of birthday pairings grows exponentially, causing the probability of
repetition to increase rapidly.
